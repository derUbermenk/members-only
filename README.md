<h3>Members-only</h3>

<p>
A project from theodinproject and was meant as practice for implementing
authentication using devise. The gist was to require clients to be authenticated to be able to post and view more details about the post of other authenticated users, hence the name. 
The specific requirements are listed in the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/members-only"> project's section </a> in <a href="theodinproject.com">The Odin Project website</a>
</p>

<p> The project is hosted in heroku, you can use the following credentials to log in: </p>


username: Constant Presence <br>
email: constant@email.com <br>
password: constant@email.com <br>

<p> The site may take some time to load, that's normal for free hosted sites in heroku </p>
