<h3>Members-only</h3>

<p>
A project from theodinproject and was meant as practice for implementing
authentication using devise. The gist was to require clients to be authenticated to view posts of other authenticated users, hence the name. 
The specific requirements are listed in the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/members-only"> project's section </a> in <a href="theodinproject.com">The Odin Project website</a>
